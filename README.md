My handcoded HTML and CSS portfolio site "About Me" page first draft

  In this portfolio site, I highlighted my skills in three areas: painting, teaching, and design. The four desitnations of this site from the main page are the Gallery, the Teaching section, and an about me page, which links to the resume. 

  In the Gallery section I featured my best paintings from the last 5 years, which show off my expertise in rendering, color application and surrealist representaiton. 

  The teaching section goes over my basic teaching experiences in a paragraph and six photographs of me leading a classroom. This is for future employers to see both my passion and experience through these examples of my classroom practice. 
  
  The final section gives a basic summary of my professional life, describing myself as an "Artist. Designer. Educator." as well as one of my self portraits, a link to my resume, and contact information.
  
  Within the content of my website (and the resume page) is where I exhibit my abilities in art and education, but I feel as though the website itself exists as an exemplary display of my design skills and coding abilities.
  
  Although I consider this my own unique website overall, I must give credit and thanks to both Professor Lara Henderson and Scrimba for giving me helpful samples of starter code for the inner architecture of my website.
